Submitted by: Alberto J. De Jesus

Time spent: 42 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [Y] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [Y] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [N] UI animations
* [Y] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [N] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [N] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

Making the base of the app was not the challenge because I could understand the process pretty easily. What was a challenge was
understanding the optional assignments because they were a little vague and I spended most of the time researching what is what 
and what is the purpose of most command. It was a very fun experience and I liked it, in this prework I have learned a lot and 
I hope I can keep learning with CodePath.
